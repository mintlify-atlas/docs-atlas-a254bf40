description: Introduction to Rowboat's local-first AI desktop application
---

Rowboat Desktop is a local-first AI coworker that builds a knowledge graph from your work and helps you act on it. Everything runs privately on your machine - your emails, meetings, and notes stay under your control.

## What is Rowboat Desktop?

Rowboat Desktop connects to your email and meeting notes, builds a long-lived knowledge graph, and uses that context to help you:

- **Draft emails** grounded in past conversations and commitments
- **Prep for meetings** with briefs that include prior decisions and open questions
- **Create presentations** as PDF slides using context from your work
- **Track projects** with memory that compounds over time
- **Record voice memos** that automatically update your knowledge graph

<Note>
Unlike AI tools that reconstruct context on demand, Rowboat maintains long-lived knowledge that accumulates over time. Context isn't retrieved - it's already there.

- **Google Calendar** - Meeting schedules and attendees
- **Google Meet** - Meeting transcripts and recordings
- **Granola** - AI-powered meeting notes
- **Fireflies** - Meeting transcription service

## What Makes Rowboat Different

Most AI assistants start cold every session, searching documents and transcripts to reconstruct context.

**Rowboat maintains long-lived knowledge:**

- Context accumulates over time across all interactions
- Relationships between people, projects, and topics are explicit
- Notes are editable by you, not hidden inside a model
- Everything lives on your machine as plain Markdown files

The result is **memory that compounds**, rather than retrieval that starts from scratch.
