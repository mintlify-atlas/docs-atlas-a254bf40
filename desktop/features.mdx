description: Core features of the Rowboat desktop application
---

Rowboat Desktop provides AI assistance that's grounded in your work context. From drafting emails to generating presentations, every feature is designed to work with memory that compounds over time.

## Core Features

### AI Copilot

Rowboat Copilot is your AI assistant for everyday work. It combines thorough explanations with genuine enthusiasm and helps with:

- **Email drafting** - Respond to emails with full context from past conversations
- **Meeting prep** - Get briefed on attendees, past decisions, and open questions
- **Document collaboration** - Create and edit notes in your knowledge graph
- **Presentation creation** - Generate PDF slide decks from your work context
- **Project tracking** - Summarize project status using accumulated memory

<Note>
The Copilot has access to your entire knowledge graph and pulls relevant context automatically. No need to search or provide background - it already knows.
</Note>

### Knowledge Graph

Your work memory lives in an **Obsidian-compatible vault** stored at `~/.rowboat/knowledge/`.

#### Graph Structure

The knowledge graph is organized into four categories:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="People">
    **People/** - Individual contacts and relationships
    
    Each person note tracks:
    - Role and organization
    - Past interactions and decisions
    - Commitments made by both sides
    - Open questions and concerns
    - Communication style and preferences
    
    Example: `knowledge/People/Sarah Chen.md`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Organizations">
    **Organizations/** - Companies and teams
    
    Each organization note includes:
    - Key contacts and stakeholders
    - Projects and initiatives
    - Decisions and agreements
    - Meeting history
    
    Example: `knowledge/Organizations/Acme Corp.md`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Projects">
    **Projects/** - Ongoing initiatives and workstreams
    
    Each project note contains:
    - Goals and milestones
    - Team members and owners
    - Decisions and blockers
    - Action items and commitments
    
    Example: `knowledge/Projects/Q1 Product Launch.md`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Topics">
    **Topics/** - Recurring themes and subject areas
    
    Each topic note captures:
    - Related people and projects
    - Key concepts and decisions
    - Resources and references
    
    Example: `knowledge/Topics/API Architecture.md`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Obsidian-style backlinks** connect notes together. For example, a meeting with Sarah Chen will link to `[[Sarah Chen]]` and `[[Acme Corp]]`, creating a web of related context.
</Note>

#### How the Graph Updates

The knowledge graph updates automatically:

1. **Email sync** - Gmail threads are processed and entities extracted
2. **Meeting sync** - Transcripts from Google Meet, Granola, or Fireflies are analyzed
3. **Note creation** - New people, projects, orgs, and topics get dedicated notes
4. **Context enrichment** - Existing notes are updated with new decisions and commitments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sources are synced">
    Emails and meeting transcripts are saved as markdown in `~/.rowboat/sources/`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Graph builder runs">
    The note creation agent processes new/changed source files in batches
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Entities extracted">
    People, organizations, projects, and topics are identified
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notes created or updated">
    New notes are created or existing notes enriched with new context
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Note Creation Strictness

Rowboat supports three strictness levels that control how aggressively notes are created from emails. Meetings always create notes at all levels.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="High Strictness">
    **Philosophy:** "Meetings create notes. Emails enrich them."
    
    - Emails **never create** new notes (only meetings do)
    - Emails can only **update existing** notes for people you've met
    - Exception: Warm intros from known contacts can create notes
    - Best for: Users with high email volume who want minimal noise
    
    **Filters out:**
    - All consumer services (Amazon, banks, etc.)
    - Cold sales and recruiting emails
    - Support representatives
    - Generic business pitches
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Medium Strictness">
    **Philosophy:** "Both create notes, but emails require personalized content."
    
    - Emails **can create** notes if personalized and business-relevant
    - Filters out consumer services, mass mail, generic pitches
    - Warm intros from anyone create notes
    - Best for: Balanced capture of relevant business contacts
    
    **Filters out:**
    - Consumer services and automated emails
    - Mass newsletters
    - Generic cold outreach
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Low Strictness">
    **Philosophy:** "Capture broadly. Never miss a potentially important contact."
    
    - Creates notes for **any identifiable human sender**
    - Only skips obvious automated emails and newsletters
    - Best for: Users with low email volume who want comprehensive capture
    
    **Minimal filtering** - captures nearly everything
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
On first run, Rowboat analyzes your emails and recommends a strictness level based on volume and patterns. You can change this setting anytime in `~/.rowboat/config/note_creation.json`
</Note>

### Background Agents

Rowboat can spin up **background agents** to handle repeatable work automatically.

**Examples:**

- Draft email replies in the background (grounded in past context)
- Generate a daily voice note each morning (agenda, priorities, meetings)
- Create recurring project updates from latest emails/notes
- Keep your knowledge graph up to date as new information arrives

<Note>
You control what runs, when it runs, and what gets written to your local Markdown vault. Agent schedules are configured in `~/.rowboat/config/agent_schedule.json`
</Note>

### Voice Notes

Record voice memos that automatically:

- Transcribe with Deepgram
- Extract key takeaways and action items
- Update relevant notes in your knowledge graph
- Link to people, projects, and topics mentioned

<Note>
Voice notes require a Deepgram API key. Add it to `~/.rowboat/config/deepgram.json`
</Note>

### Skills System

Rowboat uses a **skills catalog** to load specialized guidance for different tasks:

- **draft-emails** - Structure for drafting email responses
- **meeting-prep** - Guidance for creating meeting briefs
- **create-presentations** - Generate PDF presentations
- **doc-collab** - Create and edit documents in the knowledge base
- **slack** - Send messages and interact with Slack
- **web-search** - Use Brave or Exa for research
- **mcp-integration** - Discover and execute MCP tools

When you ask Rowboat to perform a task, it loads the appropriate skill first to ensure it follows best practices.

### MCP Tool Support

Rowboat supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect external tools and services.

**Available integrations:**

- Web search (Exa, Brave)
- Slack (messages, channels, users)
- Twitter/X (posts, mentions)
- ElevenLabs (text-to-speech)
- Linear/Jira (issues, projects)
- GitHub (repos, PRs, issues)
- Databases and custom APIs

<Note>
MCP servers are configured in `~/.rowboat/config/mcp.json`. Use the Settings dialog in the app to add new servers.
</Note>

### Version History

Rowboat automatically tracks changes to your knowledge graph:

- Git-based version control for all notes
- Automatic commits when notes are created or updated
- Full history available via standard git commands
- Stored in `~/.rowboat/.git/`

<Note>
You can use any git client to view history, compare versions, or roll back changes to your knowledge graph.
</Note>

## Security Features

### Command Approval Flow

Rowboat has two types of operations:

**Builtin tools (no approval required):**
- Reading/writing files in `~/.rowboat/`
- Searching the knowledge graph
- Parsing documents
- Managing MCP servers

**Shell commands (approval flow):**
- Pre-approved commands in `~/.rowboat/config/security.json` run immediately
- Other commands require one-time user approval
- Commands that modify files outside `~/.rowboat/` always ask for confirmation

### Data Privacy

- **All data stored locally** - Nothing sent to cloud storage
- **API keys encrypted** - Provider keys stored securely on disk
- **No telemetry** - Rowboat doesn't phone home
- **Inspectable** - All notes and configs are plain text
