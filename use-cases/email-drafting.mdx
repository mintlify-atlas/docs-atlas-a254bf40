Rowboat drafts email responses by pulling context from your knowledge base and calendar, ensuring every reply is personalized and informed by your relationship history.

## How It Works

Rowboat processes your inbox and creates contextual drafts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scan for new emails">
    Rowboat reads emails from your `gmail_sync/` folder and tracks which ones it has already processed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Classify each email">
    Emails are categorized as:
    - **Draft needed**: Meeting requests, personal emails, business inquiries, follow-ups
    - **Ignore**: Newsletters, marketing, automated notifications, spam
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Look up context">
    Before drafting, Rowboat searches your knowledge base for:
    - Notes about the sender (role, history, relationship)
    - Their organization's information
    - Related projects or topics
    - Past interactions and commitments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check calendar">
    For scheduling emails, Rowboat reviews your calendar to:
    - Find available time slots
    - Check for conflicts
    - Propose specific meeting times
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create the draft">
    A personalized draft is written that:
    - Matches the tone of the incoming email
    - References past interactions naturally
    - Provides direct answers or next steps
    - Shows you remember the relationship
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

<CodeGroup>
```text Batch processing
Draft responses to my new emails
```

```text Specific person
Draft a reply to Monica's email
```

```text With context
Draft an email to Akhilesh about the Rowboat project
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Rowboat asks clarifying questions when needed. If someone is involved in multiple projects, it will ask which topic you want to discuss rather than guessing.
</Tip>

## Draft Response

Subject: Re: Q1 Planning Meeting

Hi Sarah,

Tuesday at 2pm works great. I'll bring the updated financial model 
we discussed — the one with the revised CAC breakdown by channel.

Looking forward to continuing our conversation about the term sheet timeline.

See you then,
[Your name]

## Notes

Referenced the open item from Jan 15 meeting about the financial model.
Proposed specific time from available slots. Mentioned term sheet 
timeline as a natural follow-up topic.

## Key Features

  <Card title="One draft, no options" icon="bullseye">
    Rowboat is decisive. You get one well-crafted draft based on context, not multiple generic variants to choose from.
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Classification Logic

### Emails that get drafts

- Meeting requests or scheduling emails
- Personal emails from known contacts
- Legitimate business inquiries
- Follow-ups on existing conversations
- Emails requesting information or action

### Emails that are ignored

- Newsletters (unsubscribe links, bulk sender indicators)
- Marketing emails (promotional language, no-reply senders)
- Automated notifications (GitHub, Jira, Slack, shipping updates)
- Spam or irrelevant cold outreach
- Outbound emails where you are the sender with no reply

<Tip>
Rowboat is conservative with the ignore list. When in doubt, it creates a draft with a note explaining any ambiguity.
</Tip>

## Processing Summary

After processing, Rowboat provides a summary:

```markdown
## Processing Summary

**Emails Scanned:** 24
**Drafts Created:** 3
**Ignored:** 21

### Drafts Created:
- 19048cf9c0317981: RE: Q1 Planning Meeting - Scheduling response with calendar check
- 19048d12a0421bc3: Introduction to Product - Business inquiry from known contact
- 19048e45f1532cd7: Follow-up on proposal - Referenced past meeting context

### Ignored:
- Newsletter from TechCrunch
- GitHub notification: PR merged
- Marketing email from SaaS vendor
...
```

## State Management

Rowboat tracks processing state in `pre-built/email-draft/state.json`:

```json
{
  "lastProcessedTimestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z",
  "drafted": ["19048cf9c0317981", "19048d12a0421bc3"],
  "ignored": ["spam_id_1", "newsletter_id_2"]
}
```

This ensures:
- No email is processed twice
- You can run batch processing repeatedly
- State persists across sessions

## Best Practices

### Review before sending

Rowboat creates drafts but never sends emails automatically. Always review:
- Tone and formality level
- Specific details and dates
- Attachments or additional context needed

### Clarify when needed

If Rowboat asks which project or context to use, take a moment to specify. This leads to much better drafts than letting it guess.

### Keep knowledge base current

The better your person and organization notes, the better your drafts. Update notes after:
- Important conversations
- Project milestones
- Changes in relationships or roles

### Run periodically

Rather than drafting every single email in real-time, run email drafting:
- Once or twice daily during work hours
- After important meetings when follow-ups are expected
- Before batch email sessions
