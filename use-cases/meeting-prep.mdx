Rowboat helps you prepare for meetings by automatically gathering context about attendees from your knowledge base and calendar, creating personalized meeting briefs with history, open items, and suggested talking points.

## How It Works

When you ask Rowboat to prep for a meeting, it follows a thorough workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the meeting">
    Rowboat scans your synced calendar to find the meeting. You can specify which meeting or ask for your next meeting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Look up attendees">
    For each attendee, Rowboat searches your knowledge base for:
    - Person notes with their role, background, and history
    - Organization notes about their company
    - Project notes where they're involved
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract relevant context">
    From your notes, Rowboat pulls:
    - Previous interactions and their outcomes
    - Commitments made (by them or to them)
    - Open action items
    - Key facts about what they care about
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create the brief">
    A comprehensive meeting brief is generated with:
    - About section (role, background, focus areas)
    - Chronological history of interactions
    - Outstanding action items
    - Concrete talking points based on your relationship
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

```text Simple request

## Best Practices

### Keep person notes updated

The quality of your meeting briefs depends on your knowledge base. After meetings, update person notes with:
- What you discussed
- Commitments made
- Follow-up items
- New insights about what they care about

### Specify unclear requests

If you have multiple meetings coming up, Rowboat will ask which one to prep. Be specific to save time:
- "Prep my investor meeting" (if you only have one)
- "Prep the Sarah call" (use their name)
- "Prep my 2pm" (use the time)

### Review before the meeting

Get your brief 15-30 minutes before the meeting starts so you have time to review and prepare additional materials if needed.

<Tip>
If Rowboat finds no notes for an attendee, it will mention this and offer to help create one. This is a great opportunity to capture context before the meeting.
