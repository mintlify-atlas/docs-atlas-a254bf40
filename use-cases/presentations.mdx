Rowboat creates professional PDF presentations by generating HTML slides with consistent themes, converting them to PDF using Playwright, and delivering the final deck to your Desktop.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather context from knowledge base">
    Rowboat searches your `knowledge/` folder for relevant information about:
    - Your company and product
    - Team members
    - Projects and partnerships
    - Metrics and results
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Plan the narrative arc">
    Before building slides, Rowboat maps out:
    - **Hook**: Opening statement or question that grabs attention
    - **Core argument**: The one thing the audience should remember
    - **Supporting evidence**: Data, examples, frameworks that back it up
    - **Call to action**: What the audience should do next
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select theme and layouts">
    Based on topic and audience, Rowboat picks:
    - A unified color theme (Dark Professional, Light Editorial, or Bold Vibrant)
    - Appropriate layouts from 35+ templates for each slide
    - Consistent typography and visual style
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate HTML slides">
    Creates presentation.html with:
    - 8-15 slides (title + content + closing)
    - 1280x720px slides with proper PDF export settings
    - CSS-based visuals (no external images)
    - Consistent theme across all slides
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate before export">
    Checks for common issues:
    - Title text overflow
    - Content extending beyond slide boundaries
    - Broken visuals or missing fonts
    - Theme consistency
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Convert to PDF">
    Uses Playwright to:
    - Render HTML with full styling
    - Export each slide as a PDF page
    - Save final deck to ~/Desktop/presentation.pdf
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

<CodeGroup>
```text Investor pitch
Create a pitch deck for our Series A fundraise
```

```text Product presentation

```

```text With theme

```

```text Company overview

```
</CodeGroup>

## Available Themes

Rowboat automatically selects the best theme based on your topic and audience:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Dark Professional" icon="moon">
    Deep navy/charcoal backgrounds with indigo and violet accents. White text.
    
    **Best for:** Tech, SaaS, keynotes, engineering presentations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Light Editorial" icon="sun">
    White/warm cream backgrounds with amber and stone accents. Dark text with serif headings.
    
    **Best for:** Reports, proposals, thought leadership, research
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bold Vibrant" icon="palette">
    Mixed dark and light slides with emerald and rose accents. High contrast.
    
    **Best for:** Pitch decks, marketing, creative work, fundraising
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
If you don't specify a theme, Rowboat picks the best fit automatically. It will note which theme was used so you can request a different one if needed.

## Visual Consistency Rules

Rowboat follows strict design principles to ensure professional results:

### One Theme Per Deck

<Warning>
The most important rule: Pick ONE theme and apply it consistently to EVERY slide. Never mix color palettes mid-deck.
</Warning>

- Define theme palette upfront (primary color, accent color, neutral base)
- Use same accent color for all highlights, bullets, icons, chart fills
- Typography colors stay consistent across all slides
- Charts use shades/tints of theme colors only

### Background Strategy

**For dark themes:**
- Deep base (e.g. #0f172a) for 80%+ of slides
- Medium base (e.g. #1e293b) for subtle variation
- Accent pop (e.g. #6366f1) for 1-2 key stat slides
- NEVER use white or light backgrounds in dark-themed decks

**For light themes:**
- Light base (e.g. #fafaf9) for most content slides  
- Warm tint (e.g. #fefce8) for visual rhythm
- Accent pop for 1-2 key slides
- NEVER use dark/navy backgrounds in light-themed decks

<Tip>
Never alternate between dark and light backgrounds. This creates a jarring effect. Use subtle shade variations within the same tone family instead.
</Tip>

### Title Slide Rules

- Title text must span full slide width
- No decorative elements beside the title competing for space
- Single-column, vertically-stacked layout
- Title font-size max 64px (48px for long titles)
- Decorative visuals go BEHIND text, never beside it

## PDF Export Technical Details

Rowboat follows specific rules to ensure clean PDF rendering:

### No Layered Elements

❌ **Avoid:**
```html
<div class="background"></div>
<div class="shadow"></div>
<div class="content">Text</div>
```

✅ **Use:**
```html
<div class="content" style="background: #fff; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
  Text
</div>
```

### Slides Must Fit

- Slides are 1280x720px with 60px padding
- Safe content area: 1160x600px
- Use `overflow: hidden` to prevent content from extending beyond boundaries

### No External Images

❌ **Avoid:**
```html
<img src="https://example.com/photo.jpg">
```

✅ **Use:**
- CSS gradients and shapes
- Inline SVG graphics
- Emoji for icons

### No Footers or Headers

❌ **Avoid:**
```html
<div style="position: fixed; bottom: 0;">Slide 5</div>
```

Fixed-positioned elements overlap with content in PDF rendering. Include slide numbers or metadata in the normal content flow if needed.

## Validation Checks

Before converting to PDF, Rowboat validates:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Title overflow check">
    Verifies title text fits within slide width at set font-size. Auto-reduces if needed:
    - Short titles (1-3 words): 72px max
    - Medium titles (4-6 words): 56px max  
    - Long titles (7+ words): 44px max
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Content bounds check">
    Confirms no elements extend beyond 1280x720 boundaries. Looks for:
    - Long titles
    - Bullet lists with 6+ items
    - Wide tables
    - Text wrapping beyond available height
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Broken visuals check">
    Ensures no `<img>` tags reference external URLs. All visuals must be CSS, SVG, or emoji.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Font loading check">
    Verifies Google Fonts `<link>` includes all font families used in CSS.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Theme consistency check">
    Confirms all slides use the same palette with no rogue colors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow Example

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

```bash
# 1. Rowboat searches knowledge base for context
workspace-readFile("knowledge/Organizations/Our Company.md")
workspace-readFile("knowledge/Projects/Series A.md")

# 2. Plans narrative and selects theme
# Hook: The market opportunity
# Core: Our unique approach
# Evidence: Traction metrics, customer stories
# CTA: Investment ask
# Theme: Bold Vibrant (pitch deck)

# 3. Generates HTML with 12 slides
workspace-writeFile("tmp/presentation.html", htmlContent)

# 4. Validates (checks all pass)

# 5. Creates conversion script
workspace-writeFile("tmp/convert.js", playwrightScript)

# 6. Converts to PDF
node /workspace/tmp/convert.js

# 7. Final output
~/Desktop/presentation.pdf
```

<Tip>
The entire process is invisible to you. Rowboat handles package installation, file creation, validation, and conversion automatically.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Provide context in your knowledge base

The richer your `knowledge/` folder, the better your presentations:
- Company overview with mission, product, market
- Team member bios and roles
- Project documentation with metrics and outcomes
- Customer/partner information

### Be specific about purpose and audience

Instead of: "Make a presentation"  
Try: "Create an investor pitch deck for Series A VCs" or "Build a quarterly business review for the board"

This helps Rowboat:
- Choose the right theme
- Select appropriate layouts
- Set the right tone and detail level

### Request theme changes

If the auto-selected theme doesn't match your preference:

```text
Recreate this with a light editorial theme instead
```

### Keep it focused

Best presentations are 8-15 slides:
- Title slide
- Optional agenda
- 6-10 content slides (every slide earns its place)
- Closing/CTA

No filler content or unnecessary padding.

## Dependencies

Rowboat automatically handles installation:

```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

You don't need to run these commands yourself.

## Output Location

Final presentation is saved to:

```
~/Desktop/presentation.pdf
```

Temporary files during generation:

```
~/workspace/tmp/presentation.html
~/workspace/tmp/convert.js
```
