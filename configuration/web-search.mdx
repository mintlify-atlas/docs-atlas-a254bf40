Rowboat can perform web searches to gather information for your tasks. Two search providers are supported: Brave for general web search and Exa for research-focused queries.

## Search Providers

### Brave Search

**Best for:** Quick facts, current events, general web search

Brave Search provides fast, privacy-focused web search results similar to Google.

### Exa Search

**Best for:** Research, finding articles/papers, exploring topics in depth, discovering quality sources

Exa (formerly Metaphor) specializes in finding high-quality content and can filter by category (companies, research papers, news, people, etc.).

## Using Search in Rowboat

Once configured, Rowboat can use search tools automatically when needed:

```
You: "What's the latest news about AI safety?"

Rowboat: [uses web-search tool to find current articles]
```

```
You: "Find research papers about knowledge graphs"

Rowboat: [uses research-search tool for academic content]
```

### Tool Selection

Rowboat automatically chooses the right search tool:

- **web-search (Brave)**: Quick facts, current events, general queries, product info
- **research-search (Exa)**: Articles, papers, companies, people, in-depth topics

<Info>
**CRITICAL:** Rowboat always starts with exactly ONE search call, picking the single best tool for your query. Additional searches only happen if needed based on initial results.
