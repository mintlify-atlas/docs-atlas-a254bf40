Rowboat supports voice notes through Deepgram's speech-to-text API. This allows you to record voice memos that automatically capture and update key takeaways in your knowledge graph.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Deepgram API Key">
    1. Sign up at [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/)
    2. Create a new project or select an existing one
    3. Navigate to **API Keys**
    4. Click **Create New Key**
    5. Copy your API key (starts with a long string)
    
    <Info>
    Deepgram offers a generous free tier with 200 hours of transcription per month.

  <Step title="Create Configuration File">
    Create the configuration file at:
    
    ```bash
    ~/.rowboat/config/deepgram.json
    ```
    
    Add your API key:
    
    ```json
    {
      "apiKey": "your-deepgram-api-key-here"
    }

## Configuration Schema

<CodeGroup>
```json deepgram.json
{
  "apiKey": "<your-deepgram-api-key>"
}
```

```bash File Location
~/.rowboat/config/deepgram.json
```
</CodeGroup>

### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

## Using Voice Notes

Once configured, you can record voice notes directly in Rowboat:

1. Click the microphone icon in the sidebar
2. Record your voice memo
3. Stop recording when done
4. Rowboat will:
   - Transcribe your audio using Deepgram Nova 2
   - Extract key information
   - Update relevant notes in your knowledge graph

<Info>
Rowboat uses Deepgram's **Nova 2** model with smart formatting enabled for the best accuracy.

## API Details

### Endpoint

Rowboat uses Deepgram's synchronous API:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&smart_format=true
```

### Features

- **Model**: Nova 2 (Deepgram's latest and most accurate model)
- **Smart Formatting**: Automatically formats punctuation, capitalization, and paragraphs
- **Real-time**: Transcription happens in seconds

## Privacy

<Warning>
**Audio Privacy**

- Audio is sent to Deepgram's API for transcription
- Deepgram does not store audio files by default (check their [privacy policy](https://deepgram.com/privacy))
- Transcripts are stored locally in your Rowboat vault
- If privacy is a concern, consider using a local transcription solution
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Voice note button not appearing

1. Verify `deepgram.json` exists at `~/.rowboat/config/deepgram.json`
2. Check that the `apiKey` field is present and not empty
3. Restart Rowboat

### "No apiKey in deepgram.json" error

```json
// ❌ Incorrect
{
  "key": "your-api-key"
}

// ✅ Correct
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key"
}
```

Make sure the field is named `apiKey`, not `key` or `api_key`.

### "Deepgram API error: 401" (Unauthorized)

- Your API key is invalid or expired
- Generate a new key in the Deepgram Console
- Update your `deepgram.json` with the new key

### "Deepgram API error: 403" (Forbidden)

- You may have exceeded your free tier limits
- Check your usage in the Deepgram Console
- Upgrade your plan if needed

### Poor transcription quality

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Reduce background noise
- Use a quality microphone if possible
- Nova 2 performs best with clear audio at 16kHz or higher sample rate

## Cost

### Free Tier

- **200 hours/month** of transcription
- Nova 2 model included
- No credit card required

### Paid Plans

If you exceed the free tier:
- **Pay As You Go**: $0.0043/minute for Nova 2
- **Growth Plan**: $0.0036/minute with commitment

See [Deepgram Pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing) for details.

## Alternatives

If you prefer not to use Deepgram, you can:

1. **Local transcription**: Integrate Whisper.cpp or similar local models (requires custom integration)
2. **Other APIs**: Rowboat currently only supports Deepgram, but you can request support for other providers
3. **Manual entry**: Simply type your notes instead of recording them

## API Key Security

<Warning>
**Keep your API key secure:**

- Never commit `deepgram.json` to version control
- Don't share your API key publicly
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use read-only keys when possible (Deepgram only requires read access for transcription)
</Warning>
