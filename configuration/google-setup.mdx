Rowboat requires a Google OAuth Client ID to connect to Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. This guide walks you through generating your Client ID correctly.

<Info>
You do NOT need to publish your app - keeping it in Testing mode is perfectly fine for personal use.
</Info>

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Google Cloud Console">
    Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    
    Make sure you're logged into the Google account you want to use with Rowboat.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Project">
    Visit the [project creation page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
    
    1. Click **Create Project**
    2. Give it a name (e.g. `Rowboat Integration`)
    3. Click **Create**
    
    Once created, make sure the new project is selected in the top project dropdown.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Required APIs">
    Enable these three APIs for your project:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Gmail API
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com
    ```
    
    ```bash Calendar API
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/calendar-json.googleapis.com
    ```
    
    ```bash Drive API
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    For each API, click **Enable**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure OAuth Consent Screen">
    Go to the [OAuth consent screen page](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding)
    
    **App Information:**
    - App name: e.g. `Rowboat`
    - User support email: Your email
    
    **Audience:**
    - Choose **External**
    
    **Contact Information:**
    - Add your email address
    
    Click **Save and Continue** through the remaining steps.
    
    <Info>
    You do NOT need to publish the app - keeping it in **Testing** mode is fine for personal use.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Test Users">
    If your app is in Testing mode, you must add users manually.
    
    Go to the [test users page](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
    
    Under **Test Users**:
    1. Click **Add Users**
    2. Add the email address you plan to connect with Rowboat
    3. Save changes
    
    ![Add test users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/main/apps/docs/docs/img/google-setup/04-add-test-users.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create OAuth Client ID">
    Go to the [credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients)
    
    Click **Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID**
    
    **Application Type:**
    
    Select **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**
    
    - Name it anything (e.g. `Rowboat Desktop`)
    - Store ID can be anything (e.g. `test`)
    - Click **Create**
    
    <Warning>
    Make sure to select UWP (Universal Windows Platform) as the application type. This is required for Rowboat's authentication flow to work correctly.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the Client ID">
    After creation, Google will show:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret**
    
    Copy the **Client ID** and paste it into Rowboat where prompted.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### "Access blocked" error

If you see an "Access blocked" error when trying to connect:

1. Make sure you added your email as a test user (Step 5)
2. Verify that all three APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) are enabled
3. Confirm you're using the same Google account that you added as a test user

### Can't find UWP option

If you don't see the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) option:

1. Make sure you're on the correct credentials page
2. Try selecting "Desktop app" as an alternative - it should work similarly
3. Contact support if issues persist

## Security Notes

- Your Client ID and credentials are stored locally on your machine
- Rowboat never sends your Google credentials to any external server
- You can revoke access at any time from your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
