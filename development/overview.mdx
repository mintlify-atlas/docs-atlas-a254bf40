description: Get started contributing to Rowboat development
---

Rowboat is an open-source project built as a monorepo containing multiple applications and packages. This guide will help you start contributing to the codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ (with npm)
- **pnpm** (required for workspace protocol)
- **Git** for version control

<Note>
  Rowboat uses pnpm as its package manager because it's required for the `workspace:*` protocol used in the monorepo.
</Note>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rowboat-ai/rowboat.git
    cd rowboat
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Navigate to the Electron app directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd apps/x
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build workspace packages">
    Build the shared packages in the correct order:
    ```bash
    npm run deps
    ```
    This builds: `shared` → `core` → `preload`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start development mode">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This starts the Electron app with hot-reload for the renderer process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Repository Structure

The Rowboat monorepo contains several applications:

- **apps/x** - Electron desktop app (primary focus)
- **apps/rowboat** - Next.js web dashboard
- **apps/rowboatx** - Next.js frontend
- **apps/cli** - Command-line interface tool
- **apps/python-sdk** - Python SDK
- **apps/docs** - Documentation site (Mintlify)

<Note>
  Most development work focuses on the Electron app (`apps/x`), which has its own nested workspace structure.
</Note>

## Development Workflow

### Running the Electron App

```bash
cd apps/x
npm run dev       # Builds deps and starts app
npm run lint      # Run linter
npm run lint:fix  # Fix linting issues
```

### Making Changes

1. **Shared types/utilities** - Edit `apps/x/packages/shared/src/`, then run `npm run deps`
2. **Core business logic** - Edit `apps/x/packages/core/src/`, then run `npm run deps`
3. **Main process** - Edit `apps/x/apps/main/src/`, requires dev server restart
4. **Renderer (UI)** - Edit `apps/x/apps/renderer/src/`, hot-reloads automatically
5. **Preload scripts** - Edit `apps/x/apps/preload/src/`, then run `npm run deps`

<Warning>
  Changes to the main process don't hot-reload. You must restart the dev server to see changes.
</Warning>

## Tech Stack

The Electron app is built with modern web technologies:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Desktop | Electron 39.x |
| UI | React 19, Vite 7 |
| Styling | TailwindCSS, Radix UI |
| State | React hooks |
| AI | Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/OpenRouter |
| IPC | Electron contextBridge |
| Build | TypeScript 5.9, esbuild, Electron Forge |
