## What is Rowboat?

Rowboat is an **open-source AI coworker** that turns your work into a knowledge graph and acts on it. Unlike traditional AI assistants that reconstruct context on demand, Rowboat maintains long-lived knowledge that accumulates over time.

## Key Capabilities

<Accordion title="Memory & Context">
  Rowboat connects to your email and meeting notes, building a knowledge graph that:
  - Remembers important context you don't want to re-explain (people, projects, decisions)
  - Understands what's relevant right now (before meetings, during email replies)
  - Accumulates knowledge over time with explicit, inspectable relationships
  - Stores everything as editable Markdown files on your machine
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI-Powered Actions">
  Help you get work done by:
  - Generating meeting prep from past decisions and open questions
  - Drafting emails grounded in history and commitments
  - Creating docs and PDF slide decks from your ongoing context
  - Tracking follow-ups, decisions, and action items automatically
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Background Agents">
  Spin up background agents for repeatable work:
  - Draft email replies in the background using your context
  - Generate daily voice notes with agenda and priorities
  - Create recurring project updates from latest emails/notes
  - Keep your knowledge graph up to date as new information comes in
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bring Your Own Model">
  Works with the model setup you prefer:
  - **Local models** via Ollama or LM Studio
  - **Hosted models** with your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter)
  - Swap models anytime - your data stays in your local Markdown vault
</Accordion>

## Monorepo Structure

Rowboat is organized as a monorepo containing multiple applications and SDKs:

```
rowboat/
├── apps/
│   ├── x/                 # Electron desktop app
│   ├── rowboat/           # Next.js web dashboard
│   ├── rowboatx/          # Next.js frontend
│   ├── cli/               # CLI tool
│   ├── python-sdk/        # Python SDK
│   └── docs/              # Documentation site
├── CLAUDE.md              # AI coding agent context
└── README.md              # User-facing readme
```

<Info>
  Each application can be run independently, but they all work together to provide a unified experience for managing your knowledge graph and AI workflows.

## Integrations

Rowboat builds memory from the work you already do:

- **Gmail** - Email history and threads

- **Exa** - Research search
- **MCP Tools** - Extend with Twitter/X, ElevenLabs, Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, and more

## What Makes Rowboat Different?

Most AI tools search transcripts or documents on demand. Rowboat is different:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Context Accumulates">
    Knowledge builds over time instead of starting cold every time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relationships are Explicit">
    Connections between concepts are visible and inspectable
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human Editable">
    Notes are stored as Markdown, not hidden inside a model
  </Card>
  <Card title="On Your Machine">
    Everything lives locally with no cloud dependencies
