---

The Rowboat Python SDK provides a simple and powerful interface for building AI agents that can interact with users and execute tools. The SDK is designed around a stateless chat API that gives you full control over conversation management.

## Key Features

- **Stateless Architecture**: Full control over conversation state using conversation IDs
- **Type-Safe Messages**: Pydantic-based message schemas for reliable data handling
- **Tool Override Support**: Test agent behaviors with mock tool responses
- **Simple API**: Minimal setup with intuitive method signatures
- **Production-Ready**: Built on requests and Pydantic for reliability

## Quick Start

Get started with Rowboat in just a few lines of code:

<CodeGroup>
```python Basic Example
from rowboat.client import Client
from rowboat.schema import UserMessage

# Initialize the client
client = Client(
    host="https://api.rowboat.dev",
    projectId="your-project-id",
    apiKey="your-api-key"
)

# Start a conversation
result = client.run_turn(
    messages=[
        UserMessage(role='user', content="list my github repos")
    ]
)

print(result.turn.output[-1].content)
print("Conversation ID:", result.conversationId)
```

```python With Conversation Context
# Continue the conversation
result = client.run_turn(
    messages=[
        UserMessage(role='user', content="how many did you find?")
    ],
    conversationId=result.conversationId
)

print(result.turn.output[-1].content)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Core Concepts

### Stateless Chat API

The SDK uses a stateless approach where you manage conversation context by passing a `conversationId` between turns. This gives you flexibility in how you store and retrieve conversation history.

### Message Types

Rowboat supports multiple message types for different conversation participants:

- `UserMessage` - Messages from end users
- `SystemMessage` - System instructions and context
- `AssistantMessage` - Agent responses
- `ToolMessage` - Tool execution results

### Tool Overrides

Test your agent's behavior without executing real tools by providing mock responses through the `mockTools` parameter.
