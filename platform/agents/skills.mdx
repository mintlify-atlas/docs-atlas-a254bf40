description: Specialized guidance modules for agent capabilities and domain-specific tasks
---

Skills provide specialized instructions and workflows for specific tasks. Agents can load skills on-demand to access domain-specific knowledge without bloating their base instructions.

## Overview

Skills are Markdown documents containing:

- **Instructions** - How to perform specific tasks
- **Tool catalogs** - Available tools and their usage
- **Workflows** - Step-by-step procedures
- **Best practices** - Patterns and anti-patterns
- **Examples** - Code snippets and configurations

<Info>
**Skill Catalog**: `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/index.ts:1`

All available skills are registered in the catalog with IDs, titles, summaries, and content.

## Skill Loading

### Resolve Skill

Skills are resolved by ID or file path:

```typescript
import { resolveSkill } from "@x/core/skills";

// By ID
const skill = resolveSkill("web-search");

// By path (many variants supported)
const skill = resolveSkill("skills/web-search/skill.ts");
const skill = resolveSkill("src/application/assistant/skills/web-search/skill.ts");
```

<Accordion title="Supported Path Formats">
The resolver accepts many path variants:

- `web-search`
- `web-search/skill`
- `web-search/skill.ts`
- `web-search/skill.js`
- `skills/web-search/skill.ts`
- `src/application/assistant/skills/web-search/skill.ts`
- Absolute paths (resolved from CURRENT_DIR)

Both `.ts` and `.js` extensions are accepted.

## Using Skills in Agents

### Copilot loadSkill Tool

The copilot can load skills dynamically using the `loadSkill` builtin tool:

```yaml
tools:
  loadSkill:
    type: builtin
    name: loadSkill
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Load skill by ID
await loadSkill({ identifier: "web-search" });

// Load skill by path
await loadSkill({ 
  identifier: "src/application/assistant/skills/web-search/skill.ts" 
});
```

The skill content is injected into the conversation context, providing specialized guidance for the current task.

### When to Load Skills

Load skills proactively when:

- User asks for a task matching a skill's domain
- You need specialized knowledge for a complex operation
- User mentions specific tools or services (Slack, MCP, etc.)
- Creating or modifying agents with specific tool types
- Debugging or troubleshooting domain-specific issues

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Web Search Example
// User: "Search the web for latest AI news"

// 1. Load web-search skill
await loadSkill({ identifier: "web-search" });

// 2. Follow skill guidance to choose tool
// Skill says: Use web-search (Brave) for current events

// 3. Execute tool
await webSearch({ query: "latest AI news" });
```

```typescript MCP Integration Example
// User: "Can you search the web?"

// 1. Load mcp-integration skill
await loadSkill({ identifier: "mcp-integration" });

// 2. Follow skill guidance to check MCP tools
await listMcpServers();
await listMcpTools({ serverName: "firecrawl" });

// 3. Execute MCP tool
await executeMcpTool({
  serverName: "firecrawl",
  toolName: "firecrawl_search",
  arguments: { query: "latest AI news" }
});
```

```typescript Background Agent Example
// User: "Create a daily email digest agent"

// 1. Load background-agents skill
await loadSkill({ identifier: "background-agents" });

// 2. Follow skill guidance for agent structure
// - Create task-specific agents
// - Create orchestrator agent
// - Schedule in agent-schedule.json

// 3. Create agent files with proper format
await workspaceWriteFile({
  path: "agents/email_reader.md",
  content: "---\nmodel: gpt-5.1\n..."
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Skill Architecture

### Skill Definition

```typescript
type SkillDefinition = {
  id: string;              // Skill identifier
  title: string;           // Display name
  summary: string;         // Short description
  content: string;         // Full Markdown content
};
```

Location: `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/index.ts:18`

### Resolved Skill

```typescript
type ResolvedSkill = {
  id: string;              // Skill identifier
  catalogPath: string;     // Path in catalog
  content: string;         // Full Markdown content
};
```

Location: `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/index.ts:25`

### Skill Registration

Skills are registered in the catalog with multiple path aliases:

```typescript
const definitions: SkillDefinition[] = [
  {
    id: "web-search",
    title: "Web Search",
    summary: "Searching the web or researching topics",
    content: webSearchSkill
  },
  // ... more skills
];

// Register with multiple aliases
for (const entry of skillEntries) {
  const aliases = [
    entry.id,
    `${entry.id}/skill`,
    `${entry.id}/skill.ts`,
    `skills/${entry.id}/skill.ts`,
    `src/application/assistant/skills/${entry.id}/skill.ts`,
    absolutePath
  ];
  
  for (const alias of aliases) {
    registerAliasVariants(alias, resolvedEntry);
  }
}
```

Location: `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/index.ts:31`

## Creating Custom Skills

To add a new skill:

1. **Create skill file** - `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/my-skill/skill.ts`

```typescript
export const skill = String.raw`
# My Skill

Description of what this skill provides.

## When to Use

Load this skill when...

## Available Tools

### tool-name
Description and usage...

## Workflows

Step-by-step procedures...

## Best Practices

Patterns and anti-patterns...

## Examples

Code snippets and configurations...
`;

export default skill;
```

2. **Import in index** - `apps/x/packages/core/src/application/assistant/skills/index.ts`

```typescript
import mySkill from "./my-skill/skill.js";

const definitions: SkillDefinition[] = [
  // ... existing skills
  {
    id: "my-skill",
    title: "My Skill",
    summary: "Short description of my skill",
    content: mySkill
  }
];
```

3. **Use in agents** - Load dynamically or include in instructions

```typescript
await loadSkill({ identifier: "my-skill" });
```
