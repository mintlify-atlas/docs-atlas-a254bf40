    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Google services">
    Rowboat uses Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive to build your knowledge graph.

    ### Create a Google Cloud Project

    1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
    2. Create a new project (e.g., "Rowboat Integration")
    3. Select the project from the dropdown

    ### Enable required APIs

    Enable these three APIs for your project:

    - [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com)
    - [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
    - [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com)

    Click **Enable** for each one.

    ### Configure OAuth consent screen

    1. Go to [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding)
    2. Choose **External** as audience
    3. Enter app name (e.g., "Rowboat") and your email
    4. Click **Save and Continue** through remaining steps

    <Warning>
      You do NOT need to publish the app. Keeping it in **Testing** mode is fine.
    </Warning>

    ### Add yourself as a test user

    1. Go to [Test users](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
    2. Click **Add Users**
    3. Add the email address you'll connect with Rowboat

    ### Create OAuth Client ID

    1. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients)
    2. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID**
    3. Select **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**
    4. Name it anything (e.g., "Rowboat Desktop")
    5. Store ID can be anything (e.g., "test")
    6. Click **Create**

    ### Copy your Client ID

    After creation, copy the **Client ID** (not the secret) and paste it into Rowboat when prompted.

    <Info>

    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize and start syncing">
    After entering your Client ID in Rowboat:

    1. Click **Authorize** - a browser window will open
    2. Sign in to your Google account
    3. Review and accept the permissions:
       - Read Gmail messages
       - Read Calendar events
       - Access Drive files
    4. Return to Rowboat

    <Note>
      Rowboat will start syncing emails and calendar events. Initial sync may take a few minutes depending on your mailbox size.
    </Note>

    Your raw synced data is stored in:
    ```
    ~/.rowboat/
      gmail_sync/           # Email messages
      google_calendar/      # Calendar events  
      google_drive/         # Drive metadata
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Let the knowledge graph build">
    Rowboat runs a background service that processes your emails and meetings to build entity-based notes.

    <Info>
      The graph builder runs every 30 seconds and extracts:
      - **People** you communicate with (roles, organizations, relationships)
      - **Projects** you're working on (status, decisions, commitments)
      - **Organizations** you interact with
      - **Topics** that matter to your work
    </Info>

    Your knowledge graph is created in:
    ```
    ~/.rowboat/knowledge/
      People/
      Projects/
      Organizations/
      Topics/
      Voice Memos/
      Welcome.md
    ```

    <Note>
      Initial graph building can take 5-10 minutes for a typical mailbox. You'll see notes appear as they're created.
    </Note>

    Open the knowledge folder in Finder/Explorer or use Obsidian to browse your graph while it builds.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your first query">
    Once you have some notes in your knowledge graph, try asking Rowboat:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```text Meeting prep
      Prep me for my meeting with Alex
      ```

      ```text Project status
      What's the current status of the website redesign project?
      ```

      ```text Email draft
      Draft a reply to Sarah's email about the Q2 roadmap
      ```

      ```text Build artifacts
      Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Rowboat uses your knowledge graph to:
    - Pull relevant context from past emails and meetings
    - Reference specific people, projects, and decisions
    - Generate grounded, contextual responses
    - Create real artifacts (briefs, PDFs, documents)

    <Info>
      All queries and responses are visible in the chat interface. You can see which notes Rowboat references and inspect the source material.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore and edit your graph">
    Your knowledge graph is just Markdown files. You can:

    - **Browse in Rowboat**: Use the file tree sidebar
    - **Open in Obsidian**: Point Obsidian to `~/.rowboat/knowledge/`
    - **Edit in any text editor**: VS Code, Sublime, vim, etc.

    Example person note structure:
    ```markdown
    # Alex Chen

    **Email:** alex@example.com
    **Organization:** [[Acme Corp]]
    **Role:** Product Manager

    ## Recent Context

    - Working on Q2 roadmap planning (2026-02-15)
    - Raised concerns about API performance in standup
    - Committed to shipping user dashboard by March 1st

    ## Open Questions

    - Need feedback on mobile app mockups
    - Waiting on infrastructure cost estimates
    ```

    <Warning>
      Rowboat updates these notes automatically as new context comes in. Your manual edits are preserved - Rowboat adds to existing sections rather than overwriting.
    </Warning>
