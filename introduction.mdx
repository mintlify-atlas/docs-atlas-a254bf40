# Open-source AI coworker with persistent memory

Rowboat connects to your email and meeting notes, builds a long-lived knowledge graph, and uses that context to help you get work done - privately, on your machine.

All your data is stored locally as plain Markdown in an Obsidian-compatible vault. No proprietary formats, no hosted lock-in.

    Most AI tools reconstruct context by searching transcripts. Rowboat maintains long-lived knowledge instead - relationships are explicit, notes accumulate over time, and memory compounds rather than starting cold.

## How it's different

Rowboat maintains an **Obsidian-compatible vault** of plain Markdown notes with backlinks - a transparent "working memory" you can inspect and edit.

<Note>
  Your knowledge graph lives in `~/.rowboat/knowledge/` and follows entity-based organization:
  - **People/** - Contacts with roles, organizations, and interaction history
  - **Projects/** - Active work with status, decisions, and commitments
  - **Organizations/** - Companies and teams you work with
  - **Topics/** - Domain knowledge and recurring themes
  - **Voice Memos/** - Recorded notes organized by date
</Note>

The result is memory that accumulates over time, not retrieval that starts cold every session.

## Integrations

Rowboat builds memory from the work you already do:

- **Gmail** - Email threads and communication history
- **Google Calendar** - Meeting schedules and context
- **Google Drive** - Document access
- **Granola** - Meeting notes
- **Fireflies** - Meeting transcripts

## Bring your own model

Rowboat works with the model setup you prefer:

- **Local models** via Ollama or LM Studio
- **Hosted models** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (bring your own API key)
- Swap models anytime - your data stays in your local Markdown vault

Configuration lives in `~/.rowboat/config/models.json`.

## Extend with tools (MCP)

Connect to external tools and services via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Plug in search, databases, CRMs, support tools, and automations.

<Info>
  Examples: Exa (web search), Twitter/X, ElevenLabs (voice), Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, and custom internal tools.

## Open source and transparent

Rowboat is built in the open. Inspect the code, contribute features, or fork and customize for your workflow.
